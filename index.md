# Key Components in Understanding Explanatory Style

## Permanence: *permanent vs. temporary*
Pessimistic explanatory styles tend to see bad events as permanent or long lasting.
For me, if I pushed out bad code, I would tell myself "This is going to be broken forever,
and I'm never going to get it fixed!" With some disputation I would say "this is only a temporary situation, nothing stays broken forever. I can figure this out."

## Pervasiveness: *Specific vs. Universal*
Contain the negative features of a situation to that specific situation:
"I'm not good at any job, I always do make mistakes like this, then they figure out how bad I am" versus "Damn, a depedency was
removed when this file was changed, and that took down the build"

## Personalization: *Internal vs. External*
When things go right, make it personal. When things go bad, make it external while taking responsbility



## The usage of these three factors will compose explanatory style!
